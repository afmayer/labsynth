labsynth
Additive synthesizer for MILAB2 university course


Introduction
------------

labsynth receives MIDI data and generates audio for JACK. It is a simple
additive synthesizer, generating harmonic waveforms. The amplitudes for the
partials can be configured in various ways with MIDI CC.

This synthesizer is heavily based on the "Simple MIDI Synth (NumPy Edition)"
example program from the JACK-Client Python library.


Create a virtual environment
----------------------------

To prepare a virtual environment with all requirements for labsynth:

    $ virtualenv labsynth-environment
    $ . labsynth-environment/bin/activate
    $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
