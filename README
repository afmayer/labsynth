labsynth
Additive synthesizer for MILAB2 university course


Introduction
------------

labsynth receives MIDI data and generates audio for JACK. It is a simple
additive synthesizer, generating harmonic waveforms. The amplitudes for the
partials can be configured in various ways with MIDI CC.

This synthesizer is heavily based on the "Simple MIDI Synth (NumPy Edition)"
example program from the JACK-Client Python library.


I/O
---

The synthesizer creates two audio outputs (for stereo) and one MIDI input. These
JACK ports must be connected to other programs to make use of labsynth.


Create a virtual environment
----------------------------

To prepare a virtual environment with all requirements for labsynth:

    $ virtualenv labsynth-environment
    $ . labsynth-environment/bin/activate
    $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt


CC parameters
-------------

The synthesizer changes its sound according to MIDI CC values. The following
parameters are supported:

  7 VOLUME       Changes the output volume. 100 means 0.0 dB.
 10 PAN          Pan the output to the left or right. Value 63 means centered.
 20 ATTACK-TIME  ADSR attack time (maximum 1 second)
 21 DECAY-TIME   ADSR decay time (maximum 1 second)
 22 SUSTAIN-LEV  ADSR sustain level relative to maximum velocity
 23 RELEASE-TIME ADSR release time after note off (maximum 1 second)
 24 PARTIALS     Number of partials to render (a setting of 0 will yield 1)

CC parameter numbers can be remapped with command-line options. Use
"labsynth.py --help" to get information about remappable CC parameters.


Tuning
------

The synthesier can be tuned to a different frequency for A4 (default 440 Hz).
For this, the --tune command-line option has to be used.
